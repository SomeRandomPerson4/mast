# Point assignments

Point assignments are not just random numbers. They follow this format:

	1, 2, 3 point: easy
	4, 6 point: medium
	9, 13 point: hard

No other point values should be assigned under any circumstancs. Make sure you adhere to this when suggesting.

# Sourcing

Make sure you are sourcing problems in the same style as the rest of the handouts. For instance,

	2004 AMC 12A Problem 25

is not acceptable, while

	AMC 12A 2004/25

is.

Some examples of sourcings are
	HMMT Feb. 2004/C10
	MATHCOUNTS 2008 (adding all information is too long, but please leave a comment with full source so we can add it to solution documents)

# Solutions

For all computational answers, please use

	\ansbold{69}

to highlight the final answer. Do not use

	\boxed

or anything similar.
