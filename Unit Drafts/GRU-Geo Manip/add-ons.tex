\begin{prob}[nprime06]{}
$ABCD$ is a parallelogram with a point $P$ in its interior that satises $\angle ABP = \angle ADP$. Show that $\angle PAD = \angle PCD$.
% maybe put it in the walkthrough... totally not biased...
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[Tuymaada 2005]{}
In a triangle $ABC$, let $A_1,B_1,C_1$ be the $A,B,C$-extouch points (ie. place where $A$-excircle touches $BC$, etc.). Prove that $AA_1,BB_1,CC_1$ are the sides of a nondegenerate triangle. 
% only here because its super huge brain and definitely falls into the category of "geo manip". feel free to ignore since a similar problem prolly wont come up soon but maybe include for interest purposes
\end{prob}
