Here, we will discuss the common uses of single-variable differention and integration in contest problems that are not explicitly about Calculus.
\section{Jensen's inequality and Tangent Line Trick}
A part of why ''Trvial by Jensen's'' is often said as a meme regarding problems that may or may not involve inequalities is its true power.
\begin{theo}[Jensen's Inequality]
In an interval, a function is \textbf{convex} if and only if its second derivative is nonnegative throughout the interval and \textbf{concave} if and only if its second derivative is nonpositive throughout the interval.

\end{theo}
\section{Local maximas and minimas}
(This section can be thought of a follow-up to the graphing unit in a way, as it 
Here is the first problem I have ever solved in any contest using differentiation, which is a prime example of how the roots of derivatives can give us critical information on a function.
\begin{exam}[Stormersyle mock AMC 10/25]
An ordered pair $(a,b)$ is \textit{spicy} if there exists real $c$ such that the polynomial $f(x)=x^3+ax^2+bx+c$ has all real roots. For how many ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of integers with $1\le a,b\le 20$ is $(a,b)$ spicy?
\end{exam}
\begin{sol}
The key claim is the following: such a real $c$ exists iff $f$ has a local minima and maxima.

Since nonreal roots of a real-coefficient polynomial come in complex conjugate pairs, $f'$, which has degree 2, has either 2 distinct zeroes, no zeroes or a double root.

If it has two distinct roots, then we can draw a horizontal line between the local minima and maxima; since the polynomial is continuous, the line will intersect $f$ between the two critical points, once as $x\rightarrow -\infty$ and once as $x\rightarrow \infty$.

if it has a double root, then we can shift $f$ so that the inflection point is a triple root.

Otherwise, $f$ strictly increases (as $3>0$), and it's obviously impossible to choose a $c$ such that $f$ has 3 roots.

Therefore, we just need to calculate the number of pairs $(a,b)$ with $4a^2-12b\ge 0$, which can easily be computed to be $\ansbold{305}$.
\end{sol}

Here is a much more difficult example that still utilizes the properties of local minimas and maximas.
\begin{exam}[2021 HMMT Feb. AlgNT/9]
Find all monic cubic polynomials $f$ following the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $f$ is odd, and
\item over all reals $c, f(f(x))-c$ has either $1, 5$ or $9$ roots.
\end{itemize}
\end{exam}
\begin{walk}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Don't be scared by the problem number!
\item $f$ is of the form $x^3+ax$. Using simple reasoning, arrive at that $a<0$.
\item Consider moving a horizontal line from a large $y$ value (intersecting $f(f(x))$ once) downwards. What does it hopping from intersecting $f$ once to five times tell us?
\item Using the chain rule, solve for the local maximas of $f(f(x))$. (It might be helpful to make the substitution $a=-3b^2$.)
\item Use the fact that the local maximas have equal $y$ values to find $b$.
\end{enumerate}

Farley the frog starts at the first lily pad in an infinite row of lily pads. If she is currently on the $n$th lily pad, she has a $\frac{1}{n}$ probability of jumping to the $n+1$th lilypad. Find the expected number of lily pads that she will ever reach.
