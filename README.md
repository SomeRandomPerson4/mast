# For people less experienced with git/latex

If you do not have tex locally installed on your computer, please submit an ISSUE and describe what change you want made.

If it is a code change, label it as "edits." Use other labels as appropriate.

# For people more experienced with git/latex

You need a working knowledge of TeX Live and Git (as well as both of these installed) in order to do this. If you want help feel free to DM me (Dennis).

You should clone the repo to start, and pull before any "editing sessions."

For any "obvious errors" (say I forgot to add a parenthesis, added an extra, there's some TeX error, or I wrote $1+1=3$) you can just feel free to commit, I can see what happens because there's version control

Please send PRs (Pull requests) for any larger changes so staff can look at them.

TeX includes a bunch of junk whenever you compile so PLEASE make sure your gitignore is correct, it should absolutely not contain any latexmk files or whatever
