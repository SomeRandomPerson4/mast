# Audit Units

These units are new units that have not been checked yet. Please go through them and leave feedback if you have the time :)

We will move units back to 

## Raise an issue

If you read and do a unit in Audit and have feedback, check if an issue for the unit already exists. Otherwise, make it yourself:

	CQV-Perspectives auditing

If you think it should move to Units (approved), say

	I think CQV Perspectives is good, please move to Units

If such an issue does not exist, please make one yourself.

## Legacy

I (Dennis) haven't really been doing a good job of checking the units before approving them lately. This has not led to good results. This is why every unit is moved to Audit now. I need to make sure quality is upheld, and it would a) make me feel more at peace and b) potentially get more feedback on some more dicey units if I put everything in Audit for now.

We may periodically do these sorts of "legacy checks" to maintain quality, make sure it's up-to-date, look at units with a fresh perspective, etc.
