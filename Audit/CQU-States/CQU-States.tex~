\maketitle

Independent probability problems are very easy. Dependent probability problems are not so easy. We introduce some techniques to solve dependent probability problems by considering the possible states of the problem.

\section{Probability}
States are hard to explain without examples, so we will start with them first before explaining the theory.

\begin{exam}
You are flipping a fair coin. What is the probability you get three heads in a row before you get two tails?
\end{exam}

This one isn't hard (and probably doesn't even need states). Thus we present an example that doesn't need states to make states easier to grasp.

\begin{sol}[1]
 We start out with two attempts to flip three heads in a row, which succeeds with probability $\frac{1}{8}.$ If we fail, that means we've flipped tails and lose one of our two attempts.

The amount of ways to succeed are with one or two attempts. With one attempt, the probability is $\frac{1}{8}$ and with two, the probability is $\frac{7}{8}\cdot\frac{1}{8}.$ Thus the total probability is $\frac{15}{64}.$
\end{sol}

Now let's do this with states!

\begin{sol}[2]
Let $P_n$  be the probability of success with $n$ tails flipped. We want to find $P_0.$ Notice that $P_0=\frac{1}{8}\cdot 1+\frac{7}{8}P_1,$ as we have a $\frac{1}{8}$ chance of going to the success case. By states, $P_1=\frac{1}{8}\cdot 1+\frac{7}{8}\cdot 0.$

The rest of the solution is just arithmetic.
\end{sol}

Just because we don't succeed if we flip tails at $P_0$ doesn't mean we failed. You don't \textit{fail} until there's literally no way to succeed.\footnote{Which occurs when we flip tails at $P_1.$} Flipping tails at $P_0$ only sends us to $P_1.$

States are hard, and can get algebraically involved even if done right. The unofficial mantra is \textit{keep it simple, stupid}.\footnote{I've seen people try to define states of $P_{(H,T)},$ where $H$ is the amount of heads flipped in a row and $T$ is the amount of tails flipped.}
\begin{theo}[Probability in States]
Consider the probability of some event occurring at an initial state $S.$ Let the probability that you are sent from $S$ to $S_i$ be $x_i,$ and let the probability of success at $S_i$ be $P_i.$ Then the probability of success at $S$ is $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}P_ix_i.$
\end{theo}

A couple of reminders:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Remember that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}x_i=1.$
    
    \item If $S_i$ doesn't exist or can't happen, then set $x_i$ as $0.$
    
    \item For success and failure cases, set $P_i$ as $1$ and $0,$ respectively.
    
    \item Most importantly, \textbf{this theorem applies to all $S_i.$} Since the success and failure states will eventually appear, you can use this to set a system of equations and solve for the probability of success at $S.$
    
    \item It's okay to complementary count. The success and failure states are arbitrary. One man's success is another's failure.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Expected Value}

Let's talk about expected value with a simple question.

\begin{exam}
On average, how many times do you have to flip a coin until it lands heads?
\end{exam}

The first (and most naive) method one could think of is creating a summation.\footnote{In fact, this can be useful. At the very least, it's an interesting way to relate certain summations with expected value.} This summation would look like $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n}{2^n}.$ You could evaluate the summation to get $2.$

We should notice that $2$ is the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{2}.$ Does the same hold for other probabilities? How many times must we roll a die before we expect to land on $1?$\footnote{The answer is unsurprisingly $6.$}

To do this, let's use the idea of states. If we flip heads on our first go, then great! We're done! But if we flip tails, \textbf{we're back where we started.} Let's try to encode this into states.

\begin{sol}
Let $E$ be the expected amount of flips to land heads. Then notice $E=(\frac{1}{2}\cdot 0+\frac{1}{2}\cdot E)+1.$ Solving, $E=2.$
\end{sol}
Let's decode what the stuff in the parentheses means. If we flip heads, which happens with a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance, the expected amount of flips to get heads is $0$ (since we already flipped heads). And if we flip tails, which happens with $\frac{1}{2}$ chance, we're back where we started, so the expected amount of flips to get heads is still $E.$ And of course, no matter what happens, we will always have used up a step, so we must add $1$ to the expected value.

Can we generalize? Yes. The theorem below shall do so.

\begin{theo}[Expected Tries for Single Event]
If you have an event that succeeds with probability $p$ every step, the expected amount of steps it takes to succeed once is $\frac{1}{p}.$
\end{theo}

\begin{pro}
Let $E$ be the expected amount of steps it takes. Then $E=(p\cdot 0+(1-p)\cdot E)+1.$ Solving, $E=\frac{1}{p}.$
\end{pro}

And how many steps does it take to, say, succeed twice?

\begin{theo}[Linearity of Expectation]
If you have an event that succeeds with probability $p$ every step, the expected amount of steps it takes to succeed $n$ times is $\frac{n}{p}.$
\end{theo}

\begin{pro}
We induct. This is proven to be true for the base case. Now assume it is true for $n.$ Let $E[n]$ denote the expected amount of steps to succeed $n$ times. Then notice $E[n+1]=(p\cdot E[n]+(1-p)\cdot E[n+1])+1.$ Substitute in $\frac{n}{p}$ for $E[n]$ and you get $E[n+1]=(E[n]+(1-p)\cdot E[n+1])+1.$ Solving, $E[n+1]=\frac{n+1}{p},$ as desired.
\end{pro}

We've answered the obvious questions. Now let's show the power of states with something a bit harder: \textit{consecutive} successes.

\begin{exam}[Two Heads Up]
How many times must you flip a coin before you expect it to land heads twice in a row?
\end{exam}

The naive answer is $4$ (and it is the wrong answer!) and the reasoning for it being wrong is simple. The expected amount of flips should not be the same as having it land heads twice (without having to be consecutive). We use states to do this instead.

\begin{sol}
Let $E_n$ be the amount of times you expect to flip a coin for it to land heads $n$ times in a row. Then $E_2=(\frac{1}{2}\cdot E_1+\frac{1}{2}\cdot E_2)+1$ and $E_1=(\frac{1}{2}\cdot 0+\frac{1}{2}\cdot E_2)+1.$ Simplifying both of these equations, $E_2=E_1+2$ and $2E_1=E_2+2.$ Substituting $E_2$ into the second equation yields $2E_1=E_1+2+2=E_1+4,$ so $E_1=4.$ Substituting that into the first equation yields $E_2=4+2=6,$ so the expected amount of flips to get two heads in a row is $6.$
\end{sol}

The generalization for expected value is very similar to probability (just add a $1$ to the end).

\begin{theo}[Expected Value in States]
Consider the probability of some event occurring at an initial state $S.$ Let the probability that you are sent from $S$ to $S_i$ be $x_i,$ and let the expected amount of steps at $S_i$ be $E_i.$ Then the expected amount of steps to success at $S$ is $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}E_ix_i+1.$
\end{theo}

A couple of reminders:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Remember that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}x_i=1.$
    
    \item If $S_i$ doesn't exist or can't happen, then set $x_i$ as $0.$
    
    \item For the success case, set $E_i$ as $0.$
    
    \item Most importantly, \textbf{this theorem applies to all $S_i.$} Since the success state will eventually appear, you can use this to set a system of equations and solve for the expected value until success at $S.$
    
    \item There is only one success condition. You cannot complementary count.
\end{enumerate}
