\begin{prob}[]{1}
If circle $\omega$ with center $O$ has radius $3$ and $OP=5,$ find $\pow(P,\omega).$
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[]{1}
Consider two externally tangent circles $\omega_1,\omega_2.$ Let them have common external tangents $AC,BD$ such that $A,B$ are on $\omega_1$ and $C,D$ are on $\omega_2.$ Let $AC$ intersect $BD$ at $P,$ and let the common internal tangent intersect $AC$ and $BD$ at $X$ and $Y$. If $\frac{[PCD]}{[PAB]}=\frac{1}{25},$ find $\frac{[PCD]}{[PXY]}.$
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[Mandelbrot 2012]{1}
Let $A$ and $B$ be points on the lines $y=3$ and $y=12,$ respectively. There are two circles passing through $A$ and $B$ that are also tangent to the $x$ axis, say at $P$ and $Q.$ Suppose that $PQ=2012.$ Find $AB.$
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[HMMT 2020/T3]{2}
Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in a circle $\omega$ and $\ell$ be the tangent to $\omega$ at $A$. The line through $B$ parallel to $AC$ meets $\ell$ at $P$, and the line through $C$ parallel to $AB$ meets $\ell$ at $Q$. The circumcircles of $ABP$ and $ACQ$ meet at $S\neq A$. Show that $AS$ bisects $BC$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[Geometry Bee 2019]{2}
Circles $O_1$ and $O_2$ are constructed with $O_1$ having radius of $2,$ $O_2$ having radius of $4,$ and $O_2$ passing through the point $O_1.$ Lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are drawn so they are tangent to both $O_1$ and $O_2.$ Let $O_1$ and $O_2$ intersect at points $P$ and $Q.$ Segment $\overline{EF}$ is drawn through $P$ and $Q$ such that $E$ lies on $\ell_1$ and $F$ lies on $\ell_2.$ What is the length of $\overline{EF}?$
\end{prob}

\begin{req}[USAJMO 2012/1]{3}
Given a triangle $ABC$, let $P$ and $Q$ be points on segments $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$, respectively, such that $AP=AQ$. Let $S$ and $R$ be distinct points on segment $\overline{BC}$ such that $S$ lies between $B$ and $R$, $\angle BPS=\angle PRS$, and $\angle CQR=\angle QSR$. Prove that $P,Q,R,S$ are concyclic (in other words, these four points lie on a circle).
\end{req}

\begin{prob}[MAST Diagnostic 2020]{3}
Consider $\triangle ABC,$ and let the feet of the $B$ and $C$ altitudes of the triangle be $X,Y.$ Let $XY$ intersect $BC$ at $P.$ Then prove that the circumcircles of $\triangle PBY$ and $\triangle PCX$ concur with $AP.$
\end{prob} 

\begin{prob}[GOTEEM 1]{4}
Let $ABC$ be a scalene triangle. The incircle of $\triangle ABC$ is tangent to sides $BC,$ $CA,$ $AB$ at $D,$ $E,$ and $F,$ respectively. Let $G$ be a point on the incircle of $\triangle ABC$ such that $\angle AGD = 90^{\circ}.$ If lines $DG$ and $EF$ intersect at $P,$ prove that $AP$ is parallel to $BC.$
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[USAMO 2009/1]{4}
Given circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersecting at points $X$ and $Y$, let $\ell_1$ be a line through the center of $\omega_1$ intersecting $\omega_2$ at points $P$ and $Q$ and let $\ell_2$ be a line through the center of $\omega_2$ intersecting $\omega_1$ at points $R$ and $S$. Prove that if $P, Q, R$ and $S$ lie on a circle then the center of this circle lies on line $XY$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[IMO 1995/1]{4}
Let $A,B,C,D$ be four distinct points on a line, in that order. The circles with diameters $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $X$ and $Y$. The line $XY$ meets $BC$ at $Z$. Let $P$ be a point on the line $XY$ other than $Z$. The line $CP$ intersects the circle with diameter $AC$ at $C$ and $M$, and the line $BP$ intersects the circle with diameter $BD$ at $B$ and $N$. Prove that the lines $AM,DN,XY$ are concurrent.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[]{6}
Consider scalene $\triangle ABC$ with incenter $I.$ Let the $A$ excircle of $\triangle ABC$ intersect the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ at $X,Y.$ Let $XY$ intersect $BC$ at $Z.$ Then choose $M,N$ on the $A$ excircle of $\triangle ABC$ such that $ZM,ZN$ are tangent to the $A$ excircle of $\triangle ABC.$ Prove $I,M,N$ are collinear.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[AIME II 2010/15]{6}
In triangle $ABC$, $AC = 13$, $BC = 14$, and $AB=15$. Points $M$ and $D$ lie on $AC$ with $AM=MC$ and $\angle ABD = \angle DBC$. Points $N$ and $E$ lie on $AB$ with $AN=NB$ and $\angle ACE = \angle ECB$. Let $P$ be the point, other than $A$, of intersection of the circumcircles of $\triangle AMN$ and $\triangle ADE$. Ray $AP$ meets $BC$ at $Q$. The ratio $\frac{BQ}{CQ}$ can be written in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m-n.$
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[AIME I 2016/15]{6}
Circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect at points $X$ and $Y$. Line $\ell$ is tangent to $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ at $A$ and $B$, respectively, with line $AB$ closer to point $X$ than to $Y$. Circle $\omega$ passes through $A$ and $B$ intersecting $\omega_1$ again at $D \neq A$ and intersecting $\omega_2$ again at $C \neq B$. The three points $C$, $Y$, $D$ are collinear, $XC = 67$, $XY = 47$, and $XD = 37$. Find $AB^2$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[PUMaC 2017]{9}
Triangle $ABC$ has incenter $I$. The line through $I$ perpendicular to $AI$ meets the circumcircle of $ABC$ at points $P$ and $Q$, where $P$ and $B$ are on the same side of $AI$. Let $X$ be the point such that $PX \parallel CI$ and $QX \parallel BI$. Show that $PB, QC$, and $IX$ intersect at a common point.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[USAMTS 2018]{13}
Acute scalene triangle $\triangle ABC$ has circumcenter $O$ and orthocenter $H$. Points $X$ and $Y$, distinct from $B$ and $C$, lie on the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ such that $\angle BXH = \angle CYH = 90^\circ$. Show that if lines $XY$, $AH$, and $BC$ are concurrent, then $\overline{OH}$ is parallel to $\overline{BC}$.
