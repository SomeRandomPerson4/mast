The idea is basically “figure out what matters, then only look there.”
\section{Techniques}
We assume basic competence in 3D Geometry. This means knowing all of the volume and surface area formulas.

\subsection{Cross-sections}
Sometimes it's possible to simplify a problem into 2 dimensions. This makes it much easier to visualize. \textbf{Do this whenever possible.}

\begin{defi}[Cross-section]
A cross-section of a solid is the intersection of the solid with a plane.
\end{defi}

You can also take cross-sections of a cube and a cone. The former is used sometimes in math competitions, and the latter produces a shape known as a \textit{conic}.

\begin{theo}[Cross-section of a Cube]
The cross-section of a cube can be a triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, or hexagon.
\end{theo}

The heuristical reason this is true is because a cube has $6$ faces, and the plane can intersect the cube at any $6$ of those faces. It's not too hard to construct any polygon with less than $7$ sides.

Sometimes the entire problem is reduced significantly or just solved by taking the correct cross section.

\begin{exam}
Inside a cone of radius $5$ and height $12$ there is a sphere inscribed. What is its radius?
\end{exam}
\begin{sol}
Here is a walkthrough of the solution.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Take a cross section through the apex of the cone perpendicular to the base.
    
    \item Now you have a triangle and its incircle. Finish with $[ABC]=rs.$
\end{enumerate}
\end{sol}

\begin{exam}[AMC 10A 2019/21]
A sphere with center $O$ has radius 6. A triangle with sides of length $15$, $15$, and $24$ is situated in space so that each of its sides are tangent to the sphere. What is the distance between $O$ and the plane determined by the triangle?
\end{exam}
\begin{sol}
Here is a walkthrough of the solution.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item This is not actually a 3D geometry problem.

    \item Take a cross section of the sphere with the triangle.
    
    \item Use $[ABC]=rs$ to figure out the radius of the cross-section.
    
    \item Finish with the Pythagorean Theorem.
\end{enumerate}
\end{sol}

\subsection{Pythagorean Theorem}
Here are some demonstrations of assorted Pythagorean Theorem techniques.

\begin{exam}
Consider unit cube $ABCDEFGH,$ where $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are opposite faces and $AG,$ $BH,$ $CE,$ $DF$ are space diagonals. Find the area of triangle $AFH.$
\end{exam}

\begin{sol}
Note that $AF=FH=HA=\sqrt{2}$ by the Pythagorean Theorem, so the area is $\frac{(\sqrt{2})^2\sqrt{3}}{4}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.$
\end{sol}

\begin{exam}[AHSME 1996/9]
Triangle $PAB$ and square $ABCD$ are in perpendicular planes. Given that $PA = 3, PB = 4$ and $AB = 5$, what is $PD?$

label("$D$", D, dir((4,2)--D));
label("$P$", P, dir((4,2)--P));
    \end{asy}
\end{center}
\end{exam}

\begin{sol}
Note that $\angle PAD=90^{\circ},$ so $PD=\sqrt{PA^2+DA^2}=\sqrt{3^2+5^2}=\sqrt{34}.$
\end{sol}

For problems with tangent spheres, remember the following fact.
\begin{fact}[Tangency Point is Collinear with Centers]
If two spheres with centers $O_1,O_2$ are tangent at $T,$ then $O_1,O_2,T$ are collinear.
\end{fact}
This implies the following corollary.
\begin{fact}[Distance Between Centers]
Say two spheres $\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2$ with centers $O_1,O_2$ and radii $r_1,r_2$ are tangent at $T.$ Then
\[\begin{cases}
O_1O_2=r_1+r_2 \text{ if } \Gamma_2 \text{ is externally tangent to } \Gamma_1 \\
O_1O_2=r_1-r_2 \text{ if } \Gamma_2 \text{ is internally tangent to } \Gamma_1.
\end{cases}\]
\end{fact}
Using this in conjunction with the Pythagorean Theorem is enough to solve almost all problems with tangent spheres.
\begin{exam}[AMC 12A 2004/22]
Three mutually tangent spheres of radius $1$ rest on a horizontal plane. A sphere of radius $2$ rests on them. What is the distance from the plane to the top of the larger sphere?
\end{exam}
\begin{sol}
Let's label some points. Let the centers of the unit spheres be $O_1,O_2,O_3,$ let the center of the sphere of radius $2$ be $O,$ and let the foot of the perpendicular from $O$ to $O_1O_2O_3$ be $P.$ Note that $O_1O_2O_3$ is parallel to the horizontal plane with a distance of $1.$

Note that $\triangle O_1O_2O_3$ is equilateral with side length $2,$ and by symmetry, $P$ must be the center. Thus $PO_1=\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}.$ Since $OO_1=3$ by Fact $2,$ $OP=\sqrt{OO_1^2-PO_1^2}=\sqrt{3^2-(\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3})^2}=\frac{\sqrt{69}}{3}.$

Since the distance from $P$ to the horizontal plane is $1$ and the tip of the sphere with radius $2$ is $2$ above $O,$ the answer is $1+2+\frac{\sqrt{69}}{3}=3+\frac{\sqrt{69}}{3}.$
\end{sol}

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Notice that the entire solution was essentially just doing the correct setup and using the Pythagorean Theorem.
